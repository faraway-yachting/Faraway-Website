    desp: "We booked the Sail La Vie yacht for an 8-hour cruise to Maithon and Coral Island, and it was the highlight of my bachelorette trip! The yacht was spacious for our group of 16, and the crew was outstandingâ€”warm, attentive, and made everything seamless. From welcome drinks to fresh meals, clean cabins, snorkeling gear, paddleboard, and even an inflatable slide, everything was top-notch. Highly recommend Faraway Yacht for an unforgettable Phuket experience!",

    desp: "Truly had such an incredible time with Faraway Yachting!!ðŸ¥¹ From start to finish, the team went above and beyond to make sure our day was nothing short of amazing. We had the best time sliding down the water slide on the boat, using the underwater scooter, eating the delicious food on board, and just being on the water. The crew just made us feel special! This was hands down the highlight of my trip to Thailand. If youâ€™re thinking about booking, DO IT! Thank you Faraway for the best experience!!",
